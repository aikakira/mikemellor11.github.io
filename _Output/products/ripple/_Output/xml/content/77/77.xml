  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>If the vaccine is recommended for use and approved by regulatory authorities, MVI and GSK are committed to doing all they can to make the vaccine available to those who need it most: infants and young children in malaria endemic regions in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, the partners engaged early on&mdash;and continue to engage&mdash;with the WHO to help ensure they have all the information required to issue a policy recommendation and pre-qualification, and thus pave the way for procurement by UN and other agencies. In addition, the partners are engaging with malaria endemic African countries to ensure processes and systems are in place for decision making regarding the potential introduction of a malaria vaccine. Price should not be a barrier to access. MVI and GSK will collaborate closely with multilateral organisations such as GAVI, UNICEF, and others to allow these organisations to purchase the vaccine in large volumes at affordable prices.</p>]]></HtmlText>
