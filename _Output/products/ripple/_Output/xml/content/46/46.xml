  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The trial was implemented on top of the national guidelines and recommendations for malaria treatment and prevention. By working with those responsible for the malaria prevention programmes access to recommended malaria prevention measures (such as long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets, indoor residual insecticide spraying, rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malaria cases with artemisinin-based combinations therapies) has been strengthened and facilitated. When access to insecticide treated bed nets was not ensured by existing programs, they were distributed by the clinical trial staff. Other preventive measures were implemented in line with national guidelines.&nbsp; Parents of study children were encouraged to use ITNs and to present rapidly if their child was sick.</p>

<p>A survey conducted 14 months after the first vaccination showed that approximately 78% of children 5-17 months of age and 86% of infants 6-12 weeks of age were using insecticide treated bed nets in each of the study groups.</p>]]></HtmlText>
