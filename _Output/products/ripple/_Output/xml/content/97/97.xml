  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The results of a Phase II proof of concept trial examining the efficacy of FMP2.1/AS02, a blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate, in adults and children in Mali, were published in the September 2011 issue of the NEJM<sup>(a)</sup>. In general the study revealed that FMP2.1/AS02 did not provide significant protection against clinical malaria although secondary and exploratory endpoints suggested that it may warrant further investigations, Even though this vaccine candidate is no longer actively pursued, the results of this study provide useful information to generate new strategies for the development of vaccines targeting the blood stage of the <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>parasite.</p>

<p>This Phase II study was a collaboration between the Malaria Research and Training Centre (MRTC) at the University of Bamako, Mali, the Centre for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington DC (WRAIR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), NAID (NIH) and GSK Biologicals.</p>]]></HtmlText>
