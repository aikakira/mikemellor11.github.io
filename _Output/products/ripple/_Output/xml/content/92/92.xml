  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Adjuvant Systems have been used effectively in the development of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate for more than 15 years. The Adjuvant Systems used in RTS,S development have demonstrated a safety profile comparable to that observed with other vaccines routinely given to infants through the well-established Expanded Programme for Immunisation. GSK will continue to assess the safety and efficacy of the adjuvanted RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate as part of the ongoing clinical trials, as well as during post-approval pharmacovigilance studies.</p>]]></HtmlText>
