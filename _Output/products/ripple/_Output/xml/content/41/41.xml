  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The safety of the children participating in the trials is our primary concern. Unfortunately children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa, suffer from high rates of illness. Whenever a child enrolled in one of our clinical trials requires medical care, he or she has access to medical care, regardless of whether or not the cause is considered to be related to study vaccination.</p>

<p>All serious adverse events are brought to the attention of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee and the institutional review boards. The trial will be stopped immediately if at any point it is determined that children&rsquo;s safety would be at risk.</p>]]></HtmlText>
