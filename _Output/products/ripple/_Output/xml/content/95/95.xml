  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The Malaria Vaccine Advisory Committee to the World Health Organisation (WHO), coordinated by the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR) called for a collective effort to explore and address the challenges in developing a successful malaria vaccine. This effort resulted in the Malaria Technology Roadmap(<strong>&ordf;</strong>) that set the goal for a &lsquo;second generation&rsquo; malaria vaccine. The roadmap was updated in November 2013, and aims to, by 2030, license vaccine<strong><u>s</u></strong> targeting <em>P. falciparum </em><u>and</u> <em>P. vivax</em>. The vaccines should demonstrate an efficacy of at least 75% against clinical malaria over at least two years, with not more than annual boosters. Another objective is a vaccine that reduce transmission as a tool for elimination eg through mass campaigns.</p>

<p>The Roadmap identified as an interim, landmark goal the development by 2015 of a vaccine with 50% efficacy against severe disease and death that lasts more than one year.</p>

<p>Although the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate has the potential to substantially reduce the malaria disease burden in Africa, the protection it appears to provide is not complete.</p>

<p>Vaccine development takes a long time and even if the first results of an early-stage trial with a second-generation vaccine candidate are promising, there will still be a lot of work required before it could be implemented in malaria endemic regions. It is therefore unlikely that a second-generation vaccine could be implemented on a large scale before 2025. However, if based on the PhIII trial results the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is approved by regulatory authorities and recommended by public health authorities, it could potentially start preventing malaria cases about ten years before a second-generation vaccine would be available for use.</p>]]></HtmlText>
