<p>Model predictions were made by four modelling groups based on the final phase 3 efficacy results.<sup>(<em>a)</em></sup> Estimations assumed a vaccination program starting in 2017 across a range of estimated parasite prevalence among 2-to-10 year-olds (<em>Pf</em>PR<sub>2-10</sub>) and access to treatment of 45%. Vaccination was done at the ages of 6, 7.5 and 9 months (90% coverage for 3<sup>rd</sup> dose) and a 4<sup>th</sup> dose at age 27 months (72% coverage, i.e., 80% of dose 3). <sup>(<em>b)</em></sup></p>

<p>The Incremental Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) estimates for vaccination of young children living in regions with a <em>Pf</em>PR<sub>2-10</sub> of 10-65% from the age of 6 months with 4th doses (at a price of US$ 5 per dose) was US$87 ($43-240) per DALY averted. <sup>(<em>b)</em></sup></p>

<p>These estimates are higher than for LLINS, but similar to estimates for IRS however, not directly comparable due to studies conducted in different settings. In comparison, average incremental costs per DALY averted for other interventions (2009 prices) was for LLINs $27($8.15-$110), for IRS $143($135-$150), for IPT $24($1.08-$44.24) <sup>(<em>c)</em></sup></p>]]></HtmlText>
