  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The results published in the NEJM letter to the editor regarding the MSP3 vaccine candidate have no relation to the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate<sup>(a)</sup>. In the letter, it was reported that a blood-stage malaria vaccine targeting the MSP3 protein showed evidence of effectiveness in an initial Phase Ib study. This study was designed to investigate the vaccine&rsquo;s safety, not its efficacy. However, the study was performed in a highly endemic region of Burkina Faso, and the researchers observed vaccine efficacy in their long-term safety monitoring of the children. These results are still very preliminary as the trial size was very small. Further Phase II and Phase III studies will provide stronger assessments of the efficacy of this vaccine candidate.</p>

<p>GSK and MVI are not involved in any capacity in the development of the MSP3 malaria vaccine candidate. GSK and MVI each support diverse efforts to develop scientifically reasonable approaches toward the development of the next generation of malaria vaccines beyond RTS,S</p>]]></HtmlText>
