  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The comparator vaccines were rabies vaccine (<em>VeroRab</em><sup>TM</sup>, Sanofi-Pasteur) for the first 3 doses in children aged 5 to 17 months and meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (<em>Menjugate</em><sup>TM</sup>, Novartis) for the first 3 doses in children aged 6 to 12 weeks and for the booster dose in both age categories. These comparator vaccines were chosen because of their potential to provide benefit to the children and because they could be administered in the same regimen as the RTS,S study vaccine.</p>]]></HtmlText>
