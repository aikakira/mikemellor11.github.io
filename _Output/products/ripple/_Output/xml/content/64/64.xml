  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The significant imbalance in cases of meningitis in children vaccinated at the age of 5-17 months between the RTS,S/AS01 and control group reported early, remained throughout the study. The imbalance in cases of meningitis was not seen in young infants. This imbalance in cases of meningitis of many different aetiologies in children could be a chance finding as comparisons were made across groups for many different diagnostic classifications of SAE, confidence interval was high, most of the cases were clustered in two sites (Lilongwe, Malawi and Kombewa, Kenya), and there was no temporal relationship to vaccination. If children who received RTS,S/AS01 do have a true increased risk of meningitis, it is difficult to understand the mechanism that could have brought this about. If RTS,S/AS01 is licensed, post-registration studies will be performed to determine the significance of this finding.</p>

<p>* This case did not receive a booster dose<br>
**one case of meningism was recoded as meningitis by the investigator after analysis at month 20, resulting in one additional case of meningitis in the R3C group at final analysis as compared to analysis at month 20</p>

<p>The 20-month FU analysis showed an imbalance for meningitis of any aetiology mainly in the 5-17 month age group (RR=8.0 (95%CI 1.1-60.3)) although the confidence intervals are wide, and that this imbalance might be a chance finding due to the number of analyses conducted and non-adjustment for multiplicity.&nbsp; The imbalance was less pronounced in the 6-12 weeks age category (RR=1.5 (95%CI: 0.4-5.5)).</p>

<p>The low incidence of meningitis in the control group (C3C) of the 5-17 months of age category is not explained.&nbsp; The 5-17 months control group appears as an outlier in term of number of meningitis cases accrued compared to the other groups, especially to the control group in the 6-12 weeks age category, considering the shorter follow-up and smaller sample size in this group.</p>]]></HtmlText>
