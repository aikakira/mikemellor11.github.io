  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>This Phase III efficacy trial is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 11 clinical trial sites in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa<sup>(a)</sup>. 15,460 participants aged 6-12 weeks or 5-17 months first received three vaccine doses, one month apart, of either the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate or a comparator vaccine. In the younger age category, administration was done concomitantly with the EPI vaccines DTPw-HepB/Hib and OPV. In the older age category, no other vaccine was co-administered to avoid confounding factors. After a year and a half (18 months), participants received a fourth dose of either the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate or a comparator vaccine to assess whether such a &ldquo;booster&rdquo; dose will provide&nbsp; benefit. All subjects were followed up over 32 months post dose 1. In addition, follow-up continued until Dec 31, 2013 leading to a median follow-up of 48 months for children and 38 months for infants post dose 1.</p>

<p>Neither the volunteers nor the investigators know which vaccine is being administered in order to ensure there is no bias when interpreting the results (double-blind).</p>

<p>Researchers monitor cases of clinical malaria that are characterized by fever and the presence of malaria parasites in the blood, as well as the incidence of severe malaria and other relevant public health endpoints.&nbsp;Different case definitions have been used through a range of parasite levels; these are described in a separate document. To measure the vaccine&rsquo;s efficacy, occurrence of clinical and severe malaria cases will be compared between infants and children who received the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate and those who received the comparator vaccine. In addition, researchers will continue to monitor safety and potential side effects as well as effect of RTS,S on growth and assess the safety and immunogenicity in HIV-infected and malnourished children.</p>]]></HtmlText>
