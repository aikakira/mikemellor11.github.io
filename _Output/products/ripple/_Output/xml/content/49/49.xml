  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The phase III study protocol includes multiple case definitions to ensure balance between specificity and sensitivity<sup>(a)</sup>. &nbsp;The case definitions have been selected to be consistent with research practice wherever possible to allow generalizability of trial findings and comparability with other interventions. Where applicable for fuller interpretation of the data, multiple case definitions for a given endpoint have been used.</p>

<p>For the evaluation of efficacy, the most specific case definition is used.&nbsp; A specific case definition is one that only captures the true cases.&nbsp; In this case we specify that the child is brought into health care facility and has a temperature of 37.5&deg;C or more when seen and has a high number of parasites in the blood (<em>P. falciparum</em> asexual parasitemia (&gt;5000 parasites per cubic millimeter) in order to be sure that these were true malaria cases and not another febrile illness in a child that happened to have concomitant malaria parasites in his blood. Efficacy calculated using the specific case definition was not different from other case definitions used in the trial. <sup>(b,c,d)</sup>.</p>

<p>Cases averted are calculated based upon a secondary case definition which is more sensitive.&nbsp; It includes any child that is brought to a health centre and has any parasites at all in the blood and even if they do not have a measured fever when seen is still included if the carer says that he/she observed a fever within the previous 24 hours.&nbsp; This is appropriate because this is closer to the reality of real life practice all such children would require treatment for malaria.&nbsp; Therefore this is used to assess the public health impact of vaccination. By looking at cases prevented by vaccination with a malaria vaccine, one can have reasonable certainty that these cases are true malaria cases (&ldquo;vaccine probe&rdquo; approach).</p>]]></HtmlText>
