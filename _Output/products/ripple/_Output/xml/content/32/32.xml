  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Descriptive epidemiology studies have constantly demonstrated that the age of peak incidence of clinical malaria depends on the malaria transmission intensity and occurs earlier in higher transmission areas.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is explained by the acquisition of natural immunity early in life through repeated exposure.&nbsp; It is therefore expected that where malaria control is successful, the decrease in malaria transmission intensity will&nbsp;result in a&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;of the absolute number of malaria cases but with a delay of the&nbsp;peak age of clinical malaria<sup>(a)</sup>, and this has been observed in some settings<sup>(b)</sup>.</p>

<p>Children who receive a preventive malaria intervention, eg chemoprophylaxis, may not develop natural immunity through exposure to infection. When the intervention is withdrawn these children may have less immunity than children of the same age who did not receive the intervention. In previous Phase II studies conducted in Mozambique<sup>(c)</sup> and Kenya<sup>(d)</sup>, the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate provided clinical benefit up to 4 years following initial vaccination with no indication of an increased incidence of malaria disease in vaccine recipients compared to controls.</p>

<p>In the Phase III efficacy study, following an initial protection we observed a shift of severe malaria to an older age as protection wanes. This shift was seen predominantly in sites with a high level of malaria transmission<sup>(e,f)</sup>. This could be a chance finding. However, it cannot be excluded that this could also be a true increase of the incidence of severe disease in the RTS,S group, resulting from a delay in the acquisition of natural immunity following vaccination. The administration of a booster dose of RTS,S/AS01 prolonged the efficacy of the vaccine and allowed to avoid the shift of severe disease within the time frame of follow-up in the trial (approximately 2 years after the booster dose). This finding suggests that if a decision is made to implement RTS,S/AS01 in an age category similar to that of the older children recruited to this trial, then strong consideration should be given to inclusion of a booster dose, especially in high transmission areas.<sup>(f)</sup></p>

<p>The overall public health impact of a malaria intervention should be assessed based on the overall disease burden reduction throughout childhood, rather than on the effect at one particular point/period in time. Despite the temporary observation of a higher incidence of severe disease at older age, RTS,S/AS01 vaccination still provided an overall positive effect. Over the entire study period of 3-4 years, for every 1,000 infants or children vaccinated an average of 8 severe malaria cases were prevented after a primary schedule and even more (12 to 19 cases) in those who received a booster.</p>]]></HtmlText>
