  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Phase III trials, like those that preceded in Phase I and Phase II, are conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), Good Clinical Practice guidelines (CGP), and on-site clinical trial monitoring is conducted by GSK Biologicals. The RTS,S trials are reviewed by national regulatory authorities, and international, national and local institutional and/or ethical review boards. In addition, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) oversees the trials, supported by local safety monitors (LSM) at each of the research centres. The main objectives of the IDMC and the LSM are to oversee the safety data and data collection processes, and to check that the study participants&rsquo; rights are respected.</p>

<p>Safety is always our most important concern, and if at any point it is determined that children&rsquo;s safety would be at risk, the trial will be stopped.</p>]]></HtmlText>
