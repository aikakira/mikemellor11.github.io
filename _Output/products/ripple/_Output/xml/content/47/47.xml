  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The attack rate for malaria reported in the trial is an average of 1 clinical attack per year per child, over the different participating sites. This varied considerably from less than 0.1 episode per year to more than 5 episodes per year in high transmission areas.</p>

<p>In the phase III efficacy trial, over the first 20 months of follow-up, approximately 180,000 outpatient sick visits happened, of which almost 100,000 were for febrile illnesses. According to the study protocol<sup>(a,b)</sup>, a blood test was done to confirm or eliminate the diagnosis of malaria in all children presenting with a febrile illness. Malaria was found in 16-17% of the febrile cases, but the high rate of clinic visits indicates a very robust surveillance system for malaria in this trial, making it highly unlikely that malaria cases would have been missed.</p>]]></HtmlText>
