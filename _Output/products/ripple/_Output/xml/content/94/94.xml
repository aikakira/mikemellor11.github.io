  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>GSK&rsquo;s proprietary AS01 Adjuvant System contains MPL, QS-21 and liposomes.</p>

<p>MPL (monophosphoryl lipid A) is derived from the cell wall lipopolysaccharide of <em>Salmonella Minnesota</em> strain R595. It is the first and only toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand currently approved in a human vaccine<sup>(a)</sup>.</p>

<p>QS-21 is a saponin extracted from the bark of the <em>Quillaja saponaria</em> tree, also known as the soap bark tree or Soapbark, an evergreen tree native to warm temperate central Chile. QS-21 is a purified fraction of saponin, and has been shown to enhance both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses<sup>(b)</sup>. QS-21 is registered by Agenus Inc. as Stimulon<sup>&reg;</sup>. Agenus Inc. (Nasdaq: AGEN) is a US based biotechnology company (<a href="http://www.agenusbio.com" target="_blank">www.agenusbio.com</a>). QS-21: Quillaja saponaria Molina, fraction 21 is in-licensed from Antigenics Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc., Lexington, MA, USA.</p>

<p>Liposomes are artificial vesicles that comprise an aqueous core enclosed in one or more phospholipid layers<sup>(c)</sup>. They have been developed and studied for over 30 years as a way to deliver drugs to cells. Liposomes alone are usually inert carriers. Over the last 20 years, this principle has been applied to vaccines in order to deliver antigens and other adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells<sup>(d,e)</sup>.</p>

<p>MPL and Liposomes used in AS01 are property of GSK.</p>]]></HtmlText>
