<p>Olotu A. <em>et al</em><sup>(a)</sup>, studied children who had previously been randomized at 5-17 months of age to receive three doses of RTS,S or rabies vaccine. Vaccine efficacy over the four year follow-up period was 16.8% resulting in 650 clinical malaria cases averted per 1,000 vaccinees, over the entire follow-up period. Efficacy fell over time, from 43.6% in the first year of follow-up to zero in the fourth year after vaccination, with a stronger decline when malaria exposure was more intense. Vaccine efficacy seemed to be lower with high malaria exposure (16% compared to 45% in children with less than average exposure to malaria), the number of malaria cases averted was actually higher in children with high malaria exposure (780 per 1,000 children compared to 620 per 1,000 vaccinees among children with less than average exposure to malaria), due to the higher malaria incidence in children with more intense malaria exposure. The authors propose that waning of vaccine-induced immunity as well as more rapid acquisition of natural immunity in children in the control group may both have contributed to the observed effect over time.</p>

<p>Bejon P. <em>et al</em><sup>(b)</sup>, reported the results of a sophisticated multivariate statistical analysis using pooled data from 7 clinical trials, performed at 11 sites in sub-Saharan Africa, in an attempt to better understand what elements might influence the efficacy of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate. Results indicate that vaccine efficacy appeared to be influenced by 1) time since vaccination (waning of efficacy over time), 2) malaria transmission intensity (higher efficacy in areas with lower malaria transmission intensity), 3) Adjuvant System used (higher efficacy for more recent trials with RTS,S/AS01 compared to earlier trials with RTS,S/AS02). The analysis indicated that vaccine efficacy varied significantly according to time since vaccination from 36% to zero per cent after 3 years across different transmission settings and adjuvants used.</p>]]></HtmlText>
