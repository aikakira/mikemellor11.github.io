  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The candidate vaccine was invented and developed in laboratories at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals&rsquo; headquarters in Belgium in the mid-1980s. Early development and clinical testing of the vaccine was part of collaboration between GSK and the United States Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.</p>

<p>The RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate was initially tested in healthy adults in the United States and Belgium, before the first study in sub-Saharan Africa was conducted in 1998, involving adults living in the Gambia. In January 2001, GSK and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), with grant monies from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to MVI, signed a collaborative agreement to pursue paediatric clinical development of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate in malaria endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>The clinical development of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is being implemented by the Clinical Trials Partnership Committee, a collaboration of leading African research institutes, their Northern academic partners, MVI and GSK. With support from the Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance (MCTA) the partnership ensured capacity building at clinical trial sites to prepare them for the conduct of high-quality trials. This included building of infrastructure, provision of equipment such as laboratory equipment and X-ray machines, establishment of quality systems and staff training.</p>

<p>MVI is involved in the technical design of the trials, conducts ongoing training for trial sites, participates in oversight of the trials, and funds the sites&rsquo; conduct of the trials. GSK takes the lead in the clinical development and assumes all the clinical trial sponsorship responsibilities according to the GCP guidelines. GSK also takes the lead in the interactions with regulatory agencies and is responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate once regulatory approvals and recommendations for use have been obtained.</p>]]></HtmlText>
