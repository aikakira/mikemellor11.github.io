<p>Although comparability with other antigens is limited given differences in vaccine properties, deployment strategies, immunization rate, etc., costs estimated by Galactinova <em>et al</em> for RTS,S delivery are similar to other vaccines recently introduced in the region. <sup>(a)</sup></p>

<ul>
	<li>Financial vaccine delivery costs estimated to $0.90 to$1.91 per fully vaccinated child across the 6 countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda)</li>
	<li>Levels of support currently awarded by Gavi for new vaccine introduction:$0.80 per child for vaccines delivered to infants and $2.40 per girl for HPV vaccine</li>
	<li>Costs are higher if vaccine is delivered outside of routine schedule and if new visits would be required.</li>
</ul>]]></HtmlText>
