  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Although no correlate of protection has been demonstrated, a likely explanation for the difference in efficacy against clinical and severe malaria between 6-12 weeks old infants and 5-17 months old young children is the difference in anti-CS antibody titre between both age-categories (being 3-fold lower in 6-12 week olds).&nbsp; Similar differences in immune responses were however seen previously in Phase II studies, without impacting on the vaccine efficacy measures.</p>

<p>The analysis after 18 months of follow-up of the Phase III efficacy trial <sup>(a)</sup> has provided some clues as to why young infants respond less effectively to RTS,S/AS01 than children. Maternal antibodies are likely to have played a role as young infants with detectable anti-CS antibodies at enrollment had a lower post-vaccination anti-CS response than young infants without and a high post-vaccination anti-CS antibody titer was associated with VE in young infants. However, maternal antibodies cannot explain fully the lower anti-CS response in young infants as those without detectable maternally derived anti-CS antibodies still had a lower post-vaccination anti-CS GMT than did children. Immune interference due to administration of RTS,S/AS01 at the same time as&nbsp; EPI vaccines remains a possible factor. The fact that phase 2 trials showed that co-administration in one setting was associated with lower anti-CS responses when compared with staggered administration in another setting supports this hypothesis.&nbsp; A suppressive effect from exposure to malaria antigens in utero might be more marked in young infants than in older children who have had a longer period to acquire immunity. Finally the immature immune system of young infants may not respond as well as that of older children. In contrast with findings from a phase 2 trial, we found no evidence that priming with hepatitis B vaccine in children explained their enhanced anti-CS antibody response. Although we do not yet fully understand the reasons for the difference in efficacy observed between both age categories, these results confirm that the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate allows to further reduce the malaria burden over and above the reduction achieved with existing interventions. This was observed in infants when the vaccine was co-administered with routine childhood vaccines, as well as in older children 5-17 months of age, when the vaccine was given alone. Given the significant public health burden of malaria and the major scientific challenge of developing the first ever vaccine against a human parasite, these results are a major achievement.</p>]]></HtmlText>
