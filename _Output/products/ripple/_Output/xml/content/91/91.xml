  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The clinical development of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is being implemented by the Clinical Trials Partnership Committee, a collaboration of leading African research institutes, their Northern academic partners, MVI and GSK. The trial sites were selected for their track record of world-class clinical research, strong community relations and commitment to meeting the highest international ethical, medical, clinical and regulatory standards. With support from the Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance (MCTA) the partnership ensured capacity building at clinical trial sites to prepare them for the conduct of high-quality trials. This included building of infrastructure, provision of equipment such as laboratory equipment and X-ray machines, establishment of quality systems and staff training.</p>

<p>MVI is involved in the technical design of the trials, conducts ongoing training for trial sites, participates in oversight of the trials, and funds the sites&rsquo; conduct of the trials. GSK takes the lead in the clinical development and assumes all the clinical trial sponsorship responsibilities according to the GCP guidelines. GSK takes also the lead in the interactions with regulatory agencies and is responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate once regulatory approvals and recommendations for use have been obtained.</p>]]></HtmlText>
