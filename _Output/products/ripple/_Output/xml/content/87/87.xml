  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Mosquirix is being considered as a complementary intervention, i.e. one that would be deployed in addition to fully scaled-up access to and use of other malaria preventive measures, prompt diagnostic testing and effective anti-malarial medicines. The efficacy data published for Mosquirix were generated on top of the use of these existing interventions.</p>

<p>Results to date indicate that the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate has the potential to reduce the risk of malaria by 30-50% among infants and young children living in malaria endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa on top of existing malaria interventions (mainly bednets). Taking into account the disease burden of malaria in this region, with one child dying every minute<sup>(a)</sup>, even a vaccine with moderate efficacy could provide substantial public health benefit. However, given the efficacy profile of the vaccine candidate to date, it will be important to also continue using other malaria control interventions (such as long-lasting insecticide treated bednets, indoor residual insecticide spraying, rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malaria cases with artemisinin-based combinations therapies) according to national recommendations.</p>]]></HtmlText>
