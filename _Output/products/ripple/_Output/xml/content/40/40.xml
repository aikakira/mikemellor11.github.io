  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Informed consent is a critical process in any clinical trial to ensure that participants and/or their parents understand the objectives of a research endeavour, and the potential risks and benefits of participation. This is also an important educational and community outreach aspect of the clinical development of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate.</p>

<p>The RTS,S clinical trials follow the usual process, i.e. before the start of the trial the teams at each of the research centres hold public meetings and informational sessions. This is done with the participation of local leaders including the chiefs of the local villages. If the local community and its leaders agree that the study can be conducted, parents who are interested in the studies are invited to come to the health clinic. Prior to confirming individual consent, individual or group sessions are held with parents where they are informed in detail about previous results and the forthcoming study. Parents are encouraged to ask the clinical trial investigators any questions they would have. It is stressed that participation is voluntary.</p>

<p>Written informed consent using approved forms in the appropriate local language is obtained before study procedures begin. Those parents who are illiterate are informed about the consent form&rsquo;s content and indicate approval by using a thumbprint with a signature from an independent literate witness to the consent procedure.</p>]]></HtmlText>
