  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Data from the Phase III vaccine trials programme conducted at 13 African research centres in eight African countries (Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi and Nigeria) including over 16,000 infants and young children have been included to support the filing. This includes data from the pivotal efficacy trial, safety in HIV+ children and infants, and co-administration of the RTS,S vaccine candidate with other paediatric vaccines. Data and reports from the clinical development including phase I and phase II trials are also presented in the application, as relevant for the assessment of the claimed indications of prevention of malaria and hepatitis-B diseases.<br>
Quality data from commercial manufacturing of RTS,S, and a substantial amount of nonclinical data were also included.</p>

<p>The main clinical study is the phase III efficacy study Malaria-055. Malaria-055 is a large controlled, randomized, observer-blind, multi-centre study aiming to evaluate, in over 15,000 infants and children, the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> against malaria disease caused by <em>P. falciparum</em> infection, across diverse malaria transmission settings in SSA<sup> (a)</sup>. Study results including co-primary endpoints and efficacy and safety over 3-4 years and the effect of a booster dose have been published<sup> (b,c,d,e)</sup>. Three centres of the Malaria-055 will follow-up children to further evaluate efficacy and safety over an additional 3 years&nbsp; in the Malaria-076, an open-label study (January 2014 to December 2016)<sup> (f)</sup></p>

<p>The concomitant use with other vaccines was evaluated in two other studies besides the Malaria-055:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Malaria-050: safety, immunogenicity and efficacy when given with DTPw-HepB/Hib, measles and yellow fever vaccines <sup>(g)</sup></li>
	<li>Malaria-063: safety/immunogenicity when given with <em>Infanrix</em> /Hib + OPV, <em>Synflorix</em> and <em>Rotarix</em> <sup>&nbsp;(h)</sup></li>
	<li>The characterization of immune responses to the candidate vaccine was mainly done in phase II trials; vaccine lot-to-lot consistency was evaluated in two phase III trials:</li>
	<li>Malaria-061 lot-to-lot consistency with respect of the anti-CS response in children 5-17 months<sup> (i)</sup></li>
	<li>Malaria-063 lot-to-lot consistency with respect of the anti-HBs response in infants 6-12 weeks<sup> (h)</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Safety and immunogenicity in special populations have been assessed in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Malaria-055: subgroup analysis in HIV seropositive children, low-for-weight children and pre-term infants</li>
	<li>Malaria-058 trial <sup>(j)</sup>, 200 children 6 weeks to 17 months with a known HIV seropositive status.</li>
