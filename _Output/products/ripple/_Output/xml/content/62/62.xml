  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>More than 11,000 children have been vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 in the Phase II and Phase III trials and, to date, the vaccine was shown to have an overall acceptable tolerability and safety profile<sup>(a,b,c,d)</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>The most commonly reported adverse reactions were fever (27%), irritability (14%) and injection site reactions such as pain (16%) and swelling (7%)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Very few of these reactions were of severe intensity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The most serious adverse reaction was febrile convulsions (within 7 days post-vaccination) (0.1%)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Within 7 days after the first 3 doses,the incidence of febrile convulsion per 1000 doses was:
	<ul>
		<li>in the children category (aged 5-17 months at time of first dose):1.04 in the RTS,S group and 0.57 in the control, for a risk ratio of 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6 to 4.9)</li>
		<li>In the infants category (aged 6-12 weeks at time of first dose): no increased risk of febrile convulsion was observed after the 3 first doses, which is coherent with the peak of incidence of febrile convulsion (18 months of age)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Within the 7 days after the 4<sup>th</sup> dose, the incidence of febrile convulsions per 1000 doses was:
	<ul>
		<li>in the children category: 2.5 in the R3R group, 1.2 in the R3C group, and 0.4 in the C3C group</li>
		<li>in the infants category: 2.2 in the R3R group, 0.0 in the R3C group, and 0.5 in the C3C group</li>
		<li>Over 30 days post vaccination, the overall rates of febrile convulsions were similar between groups</li>
		<li>Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency<sup>(e)</sup>:
		<ul>
			<li>Very common&nbsp;&ge; 1/10</li>
			<li>Common&nbsp;&ge; 1/100 to &lt; 1/10</li>
			<li>Uncommon&nbsp;&ge; 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</ul>
