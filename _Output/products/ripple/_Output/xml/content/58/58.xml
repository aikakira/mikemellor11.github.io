  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Despite major efforts in control measures over the past decade one child dies every minute due to malaria, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the remarkable progress achieved the last decade is threatened by the spread of insecticide resistant mosquitoes and drug resistant parasites and also sustainability. <sup>(a)</sup> A vaccine that would allow to further reduce the remaining malaria disease burden by 30-50% would still provide a significant public health benefit. The use of other malaria interventions (mainly ITNs and ACTs) has been optimized in the pivotal RTS,S phase III efficacy trial according to the national guidelines and recommendations for malaria treatment and prevention. The clinical efficacy of RTS,S as measured in the trial therefore actually reflects the protection provided by RTS,S in addition to the protection provided by the other interventions.</p>

<p>As an example of the success of vector control combined with bednets and effective drug treatments, Zanzibar&rsquo;s control program has exceeded expectations, but we need to keep in mind that Zanzibar is an island, isolated from mainland, and that considerable resources from outside donors are needed to maintain their multipronged control strategy. Another example of success has been Rwanda, which achieved remarkable reductions in malaria incidence between 2005 and 2008. However in 2009, due to a delay in ITNs availability, the malaria incidence increased again until new bednets became available and were distributed, demonstrating the challenges to sustaining success in an environment where a prevention program had significantly reduced the disease threat. A mix of existing and new tools is needed to further reduced the burden of malaria. Even a moderately effective malaria vaccine, as an additional tool for a comprehensive toolbox, could help to achieve improved and sustained malaria control.</p>]]></HtmlText>
