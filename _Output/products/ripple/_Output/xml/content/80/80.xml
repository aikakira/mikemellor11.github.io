  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>In July 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave a positive scientific opinion on the benefit-risk of RTS,S &ndash; now known as Mosquirix &ndash; in children aged 6 weeks to 17 months. <sup>(a)</sup> The positive opinion from the EMA is the first step in the regulatory and policy process toward making Mosquirix available as an addition to existing tools currently recommended for malaria prevention.</p>

<p>In November 2015, WHO recommended 3-5 large pilot implementation projects in sub-Saharan Africa with moderate-to-high malaria transmission to understand how to best use RTS,S to protect young children against malaria. The pilot projects should evaluate the additional contacts with the health care system needed to deliver the four doses to children from the age of 5 months. <sup>(b)</sup></p>

<p>This will be followed in 2016 by a technical variation to EMA and application for WHO pre-qualification.</p>

<p>The last step will be the application for marketing authorisation to national health authorities in sub-Saharan Africa. EMA&rsquo;s positive scientific opinion will be the basis for these applications that are a mandatory step on the way toward the implementation of Mosquirix through African national immunisation programmes.</p>

<p>The timing or duration of these steps is yet to be established. Based on experiences with other vaccines, it is likely to take a couple of years.</p>]]></HtmlText>
