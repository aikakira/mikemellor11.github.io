  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The malaria parasite has a very complex lifecycle within the human body. After entering its host&rsquo;s bloodstream, the parasite goes through several &lsquo;stages&rsquo; in various locations throughout the body. The parasite first infects the liver, and later infects the red blood cells, which is when clinical symptoms are observed. The parasite uses different proteins to survive in the liver cells compared to those it uses to survive in red blood cells. Therefore, vaccines that target proteins used by the parasite during the liver stage (such as RTS,S) do not protect against the blood stage parasites when other proteins (such as MSP3, AMA1 or FMP2.1) are used by the parasite to survive.</p>]]></HtmlText>
