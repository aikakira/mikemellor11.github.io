  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The target for this vaccine is children aged 6 weeks to 17 months based on evidence of high malaria disease burden in sub-Saharan-Africa in children below 2 years of age.</p>

<p>The study was designed to assess vaccine efficacy in infants 6-12 weeks old and children 5-17 months old. These two age categories were selected based on the existing Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) of the WHO in African countries, offering at least 4 vaccination visits at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, and 9 months of age. The age categories were selected to be completely aligned with the EPI schedule (infants 6 to 12 weeks), or to be completely out of the time frame of the EPI schedule (children 5 to 17 months) in order to not jeopardise the compliance to the EPI vaccination schedule. Since in study Malaria-055, EPI vaccines were given to infants 6 to 12 weeks as per protocol, no children were enrolled between these two age ranges.</p>

<p>The older children were enrolled first because they were already available in the study areas at the time the trial started. The younger infants took longer to enrol because we had to wait for them to be born. Starting enrolment in the younger age category first would have had serious impacts on speed of enrolment of older children, since many of the potential study participants would already have been enrolled at an earlier age.</p>]]></HtmlText>
