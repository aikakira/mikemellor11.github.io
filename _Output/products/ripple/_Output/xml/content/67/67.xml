  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Mosquirix<sup>TM</sup> can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines including diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), whole cell pertussis (Pw), acellular pertussis (Pa), hepatitis B (HepB), <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib), oral polio (OPV), measles, yellow fever, rotavirus and pneumococcal&nbsp; conjugate vaccines (PCV).<sup> (a)</sup></p>

<ul>
	<li>If RTS,S/AS01 is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be administered at different sites.<sup>(a)</sup></li>
	<li>Concomitant administration of rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with RTS,S/AS01 may reduce the antibody response to the circumsporozoite (CS) antigen of RTS,S. The impact of this observation on the level of protection induced by RTS,S/AS01 is currently unknown. <sup>(a) </sup></li>
	<li>The co-administration of Mosquirix<sup>TM</sup> with PCV increases the risk of fever within 7 days post-vaccination <sup>(a)</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>RTS,S/AS01 vaccine formulations were evaluated in co-administration with the following licensed vaccines<sup>(c,d)</sup>: DTPw/Hib (<em>TETRActHib</em>), DTPa/Hib <em>(Infanrix Hib)</em>, DTPw-HepB/Hib (<em>Tritanrix-HepB/Hib</em>), OPV (<em>Polio Sabin</em>), measles (<em>Rouvax/Attenuated Live Measles Vaccine</em>), yellow fever (<em>Stamaril</em>), rotavirus <em>(Rotarix)</em> and pneumococcal conjugated <em>(Synflorix)</em> vaccines.</p>

<p>The non-inferiority of the immune response was demonstrated for D, T, Pw, Pa, Hib, polio and pneumococcal antigens (except for pneumococcal serotype 18C); although there was a trend for lower antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for these antigens when compared to the control group. These observations were considered as not clinically significant.<sup>(a)</sup></p>

<p>In a clinical study in infants aged 8-12 weeks, fever was reported more frequently in infants receiving PCV in co-administration with Mosquirix, DTPa/Hib and OPV simultaneously (26%), as compared to infants receiving only Mosquirix, DTPa/Hib and OPV (14%). However, the frequency of grade 3 fever (defined as axillary temperature &gt; 39.0&deg;C) was low (&le; 1%).<sup>(a,d)</sup></p>

<p>Another study,<strong> Malaria-073</strong><sup>(e)</sup>, is a Phase IIIb randomized, open-label, controlled study to evaluate the non-inferiority of immune response and the safety of the RTS,S/AS01, when administered as primary vaccination with or without co-administration of yellow fever (<em>Stamaril</em>&reg;), measles and rubella (<em>MR-VAC</em>&trade;) vaccines at 6, 7.5 and 9 months of age to children living in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>]]></HtmlText>
