  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Malaria gets progressively more dangerous as the number of parasites in the blood increase. A malaria infection becomes &ldquo;clinical malaria&rdquo; when the child develops symptoms associated with that infection as it progresses. Typically, clinical malaria is characterised by a fever associated with a significant proportion of red blood cells infected with <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria parasites. Other symptoms of malaria may include shivering, vomiting and headache. Symptoms of malaria vary however with age. In addition, they are nonspecific and common to many other diseases. It is therefore not possible to accurately diagnose malaria based on clinical criteria, and the diagnosis of malaria needs to be confirmed by laboratory testing (blood smear microscopy or Rapid Diagnostic Test, RDT).</p>

<p>In some cases this can develop into severe malaria, with more severe consequences affecting the blood, brain and kidneys. Severe anaemia and respiratory distress are the most frequent causes of hospitalization due to malaria and occur usually in younger children around one year of age. Neurological manifestations (cerebral malaria) are less frequent but can lead to long-term sequelae. Cerebral malaria tends to occur later in life with a peak incidence between 2 and 3 years of age. In some cases severe malaria may cause death.</p>]]></HtmlText>
