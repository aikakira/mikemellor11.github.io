  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>An adjuvant is a substance which enhances the immune response against a vaccine antigen. Adjuvants, such as aluminium salts, have been used in vaccine formulations to enhance the immune response of vaccines for more than 80 years.</p>

<p>GSK&rsquo;s proprietary Adjuvant Systems (AS) utilise a combination of two or more different adjuvants to enhance and guide the immune responses against the antigens contained in the vaccine. Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluated different Adjuvant Systems for the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate and demonstrated that the enhanced antibody and cellular immune responses observed with AS01 also resulted in a trend towards improved vaccine efficacy against malaria infection and disease while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. This most promising AS01 adjuvanted formulation of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate was selected for further testing in the ongoing Phase III studies.</p>]]></HtmlText>
