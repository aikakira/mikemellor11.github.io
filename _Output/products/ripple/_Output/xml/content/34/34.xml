  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Prophylactic use of anti-malaria drugs is a medical practice that has been used for decades and is still widely used to protect travellers moving to malaria endemic regions. Prophylactic anti-malaria drugs are recommended by the WHO for targeted risk groups<sup>(a)</sup> such as pregnant women (Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy or IPTp) and in some circumstances infants (IPTi) or young children (Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis or SMC). Discussions are ongoing about whether this recommendation should be further extended, since there are concerns that the wider use of anti-malaria treatments may increase the risk of developing and/or spreading resistance of the malaria parasite against the drugs used for prevention.</p>]]></HtmlText>
