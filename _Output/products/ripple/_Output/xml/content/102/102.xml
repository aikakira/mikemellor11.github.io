  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>In this collaborative study<sup>(a)</sup>, a prime-boost approach i.e., a single dose of Crucell&rsquo;s Ad35.CS.01 malaria candidate vaccine, followed by two doses of RTS,S/AS01 was compared to three doses of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate vaccine alone. The Ad35.CS.01 is a viral vector, Adenovirus 35, encoding the CS protein which is also present in RTS,S.</p>

<p>Results of an interim analysis<sup>(b)</sup> showed that the Ad35.CS.01-RTS,S/AS01 combination failed the study objective to increase by at least 50% the vaccine efficacy provided by RTS,S/AS01 alone. This vaccine combination is no longer pursued.</p>]]></HtmlText>
