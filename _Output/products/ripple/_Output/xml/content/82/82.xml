  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>An application was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), to obtain a scientific opinion using a specific procedure called <em>Article 58 </em>of the EU medicines legislation. This procedure allows the EMA to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of a candidate vaccine or medicine for a disease of major public health interest, but intended exclusively for use outside the European Union while being manufactured in the European Union. This assessment is done by the EMA in collaboration with WHO, and requires products to meet the same standards as vaccines or medicines intended for use in the European Union.</p>

<p>The positive opinion from the EMA in July 2015 <sup>(a)</sup> is the first step in the regulatory and policy process toward making Mosquirix available as an addition to existing tools currently recommended for malaria prevention. Next, GSK will seek WHO prequalification for Mosquirix<sup>TM</sup>, in order to allow United Nation agencies, such as UNICEF, to purchase the vaccine in partnership with developing countries. This positive opinion would also be the basis for Marketing Authorisation Applications to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>In addition to regulatory processes, the pathway to implementation also requires policy recommendations by international and national public health authorities. <sup>(b)</sup></p>]]></HtmlText>
