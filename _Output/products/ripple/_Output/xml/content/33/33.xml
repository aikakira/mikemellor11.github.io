  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The RTS,S vaccine candidate is being developed to reduce the number of cases of malaria and their consequences among the most vulnerable population &ndash; infants and children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa. If approved for use, a safe and effective vaccine would be an important component of a comprehensive malaria control programme and could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives. Enhanced disease control being the primary focus, the development of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is currently not targeted toward being a component of a malaria elimination or eradication strategy.</p>

<p>However, the RTS,S vaccine candidate, being a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine, has a clear direct biological effect on <em>P. falciparum</em> infection, which may be a useful component for a malaria elimination/eradication program. Such program would probably however require malaria interventions that are highly efficacious in reducing parasite transmission to be applied to a wider age group than only infants and young children.</p>]]></HtmlText>
