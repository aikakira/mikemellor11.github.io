  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>GSK and MVI are committed to further monitoring the safety and assessing the real-life effectiveness of RTS,S, its benefit/risk profile in infants and young children living in malaria endemic regions, and its compatibility with current immunisation schedules. The studies below have been agreed upon with European Medicines Agency as part of the approved Risk Management plan <sup>(a)</sup></p>

<p>Malaria-073<sup>(a)</sup>, is a Phase IIIb study to further evaluate co-administration with measles, rubella and yellow fever vaccines.</p>

<p>Malaria-076<sup>(b)</sup> is an open-labelled Phase IIIa study to follow-up children in three centres of the Malaria-055 (Nanoro, Korogwe and &nbsp;Kombewa)&nbsp;to further evaluate efficacy and safety over an additional 3 years (January 2014 to December 2016).</p>

<p>Phase IV studies are also being developed for pharmacovigilance and impact of the vaccine, as part of a post-approval plan to accompany first widespread implementation. Additional operational and health-economic studies are also planned. Currently, three studies are included in the post-approval program.</p>

<p>EPI-MAL-002<sup>(c)</sup>: A prospective epidemiological pre-licensure surveillance study to assess baseline incidence of adverse events of specific interest (AESI), of other adverse events leading to hospitalization and death and of meningitis in 40,000 infants and children below 3 or 5 years of age. Study started in 2015in some centres&nbsp;in geographical areas with Health and Demographic Surveillance System.</p>

<p>EPI-MAL-003<sup>(d)</sup>: A post-approval safety-surveillance study in 40,000 infants and children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 in sub-Saharan Africa by public health sector. This study will also measure impact of the vaccine on malaria disease as measured by malaria diagnosed at health facilities.</p>

<p>EPI-MAL-005<sup>(e)</sup>: &nbsp;A study of malaria epidemiology running alongside the EPI-MAL-002 and 003 will measure changes over time in parasite prevalence among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations and monitor changes in usage of malaria prevention measures in areas where these other studies will take place.</p>

<p>EPI-MAL-010 <sup>(</sup><sup>f)</sup>: This study will use samples from the EPI-MAL-005 to monitor the genetic diversity in CS sequences in parasite populations pre- and post- introduction of RTS,S.</p>

<p>Malaria-094 <sup>(g)</sup>, is a Phase IIb open-label study to evaluate efficacy in children of different timings of the fourth dose, as well to evaluate the efficacy of additional vaccine doses either as full dose orfractional (1/5<sup>th</sup> of standard) vaccine doses. Planned study start from the end of 2016.</p>]]></HtmlText>
