  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The mechanisms by which the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate prevents malaria cases from&nbsp; occurring are completely different from those used by drugs to attack the malaria parasite. There is no reason to assume that resistance of the malaria parasite against malaria drugs would also have an effect on the efficacy of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate.</p>

<p>In addition, there&nbsp;are no data available to substantiate that RTS,S would accelerate the emergence of resistance of the malaria parasite against malaria drugs. There is also no biologically plausible mechanism that could explain how such effect might happen. If the number of malaria cases would be reduced following the introduction of the RTS,S vaccine, there would be less need to use anti-malaria drugs and therefore potentially less pressure for drug resistance to emerge.</p>]]></HtmlText>
