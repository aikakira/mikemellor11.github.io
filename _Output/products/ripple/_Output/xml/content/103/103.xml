  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>We have been following the development of Sanaria and other vaccine candidates with interest. These vaccine candidates are in less advanced stages of development. What we do know is that typical vaccine development takes many years and has many hurdles to overcome. We are highly focused on RTS,S, the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate that is in a Phase 3 trial&mdash;the stage leading to submission for regulatory approval.</p>

<p>These are preliminary results of a first phase I trial with this vaccine injected directly in the bloodstream (intravenously)<sup>(a)</sup>. It showed high protective efficacy in 6 volunteers who received 5 successive vaccinations with high doses of vaccine. Efficacy was lower (60%) for those volunteers that received 4 vaccinations with the highest vaccine dose and no efficacy was seen for lower vaccine doses. The authors point out that these results will need to be confirmed in larger numbers of volunteers, including African volunteers living in malaria endemic areas.</p>

<p>The editorial in Science points out that the further development of this vaccine still has a long way to go and will take several years. In addition manufacturing processes, the storage conditions in liquid nitrogen, and the intravenous route of vaccine administration are all mentioned as significant logistical challenges that still to be overcome.</p>

<p>Similar results for RTS,S (6 volunteers fully protected out of 7) were already published in 1997<sup>(b)</sup>.</p>]]></HtmlText>
