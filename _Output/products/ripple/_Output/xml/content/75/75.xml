  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The partnership believes that no child should be deprived of a malaria vaccine because their parents can&rsquo;t afford it. If countries decide to implement the vaccine, it should reach those who need it most: children living in malaria endemic regions in Africa. Two things need to happen so that cost will not be a barrier to access:<br>
First, in most African countries current childhood vaccines are provided to children for free. GSK and MVI trust that this would also apply for a malaria vaccine.<br>
Second, funding mechanisms exist today to ensure that childhood vaccines are made available to African communities, with limited financial contributions from the countries. GSK and MVI hope that similar mechanisms will be put in place for a malaria vaccine.</p>]]></HtmlText>
