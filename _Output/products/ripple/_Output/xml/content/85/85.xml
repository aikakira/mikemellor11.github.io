  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>In November 2015, WHO recommended 3-5 large pilot implementation projects in sub-Saharan Africa with moderate-to-high malaria transmission to understand how to best use RTS,S to protect young children against malaria.<sup> (a) </sup>&nbsp;The pilot projects should evaluate the additional contacts with the health care system needed to deliver the four doses to children from the age of 5 months as well as potential impact on mortality. WHO estimates that the pilot implementation programme will generate critical evidence to enable decision-making about the potential wider scale use of this vaccine in 3-5 years&rsquo; time. <sup>(a) </sup></p>

<p>A WHO policy recommendation is the global equivalent of a national public health authority&#39;s (e.g. Ministry of Health&rsquo;s) decision about use of vaccines. Many countries appreciate guidance from the WHO policy recommendation process on which vaccines they should consider for introduction in their national immunization programmes. Similarly, donor agencies, such as the GAVI Alliance, require a WHO recommendation for use before funding procurement of vaccines for developing countries.</p>

<p>The last step will be the application for marketing authorisation to national health authorities in sub-Saharan Africa. EMA&rsquo;s positive scientific opinion <sup>(b)</sup> will be the basis for these applications that are a mandatory step on the way toward the implementation of Mosquirix through African national immunisation programmes.</p>]]></HtmlText>
