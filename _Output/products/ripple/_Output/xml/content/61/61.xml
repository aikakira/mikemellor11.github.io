  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>We currently do not know why the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is only moderately efficacious, but it is not overly surprising given that even people living in malaria endemic regions develop only partial immunity against malaria, despite being exposed regularly to infection by the malaria parasites.</p>

<p>A pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine like the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate should help the body&rsquo;s immune system kill sporozoites before they can infect a significant proportion of red blood cells and cause disease. However, only one sporozoite escaping the vaccine induced defence mechanisms is sufficient to start a blood stage infection resulting in clinical disease. Vaccine efficacy against clinical disease refers to the reduction in the risk of a child becoming infected and experiencing malaria disease and reflects the reduction of the number of malaria episodes for any child vaccinated.</p>

<p>In the phase III efficacy study, for every thousand vaccinees RTS,S was able to prevent more than thousands of clinical malaria cases in some of the trial sites over the four years of the study thus demonstrating the substantial public health benefit which can be provided by a vaccine with moderate efficacy on top of other control measures such as bednets.</p>]]></HtmlText>
