  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>GSK is investigating tafenoquine, an 8-aminoquinoline, for the treatment and relapse prevention (radical cure) of <em>P. vivax</em> malaria. Tafenoquine is given as a single dose and is being co-administered with chloroquine to evaluate a 3-day treatment course. Tafenoquine is being developed in partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). It was originally discovered by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and licensed by GSK from the US Army in 1995.</p>

<p>Top-line safety and efficacy results from Part 1 (PhIIb, dose-selection) of the seamless Phase II/III Study (TAF112582 DETECTIVE) were published in the Lancet in December 2013<sup>(a)</sup>. The Part 2 of the study (Phase III, pivotal for first registration) is planned to start in 1H2014.</p>]]></HtmlText>
