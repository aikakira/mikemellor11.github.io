  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The RTS,S vaccine candidate targets the <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. More than 90% of all malaria cases caused by the <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria parasite and the great majority of malaria deaths occur in children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa. We therefore are developing this vaccine for the population in most need.</p>

<p>In other malaria endemic areas such as Asia and Latin America, malaria can also be caused by other forms of the <em>Plasmodium</em> parasite, against which RTS,S is not providing protection. To cover areas with different malaria transmission intensities, 11 research centres across seven sub-Saharan African countries were selected to participate in the large scale Phase III efficacy trial.</p>

<p>Before starting clinical trials in African children, the safety and efficacy of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate had been evaluated in adult volunteers in the United States, Belgium and The Gambia. The RTS,S clinical trials are designed to adhere to the strictest international and national safety and ethical guidelines, including rigorous informed consent procedures.</p>]]></HtmlText>
