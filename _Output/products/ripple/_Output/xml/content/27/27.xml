  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>The RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate aims to trigger the immune system to defend against the <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria parasite when it first enters the human host&rsquo;s bloodstream and/or when the parasite infects liver cells. This is the pre-erythrocytic part of the parasites lifecycle and explains why RTS,S is commonly referred to as a pre-erythrocytic vaccine. RTS,S is designed to prevent the parasite from infecting, maturing and multiplying in the liver, and from re-entering the bloodstream and invading red blood cells, at which point the infected person would begin to show symptoms of the disease<sup>(a)</sup>.</p>

<p>Although no correlate of protection has currently been established, both humoral and cellular immune responses are considered to contribute to protection against&nbsp;<em>P. falciparum.&nbsp;</em><sup>(b)&nbsp;</sup>To stimulate an immune response to the malaria parasite, a portion of the circumsporozoite protein (the surface protein that helps the malaria parasite invade human liver cells) was fused with the hepatitis B surface protein (HBsAg). This &lsquo;RTS&rsquo; fusion protein is expressed together with &lsquo;free&rsquo; HBsAg (&rsquo;S&rsquo;) in yeast cells (<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>), allowing spontaneous formation of &lsquo;RTS,S&rsquo; particles known to enhance immune responses to the antigen. The addition of one of GSK&rsquo;s proprietary Adjuvant Systems (AS01) aims to further improve the immune response to the antigen and thereby induce protection<sup>(c,d)</sup>.</p>]]></HtmlText>
