  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Partnerships such as the collaboration between GSK and the MVI program at PATH are important for several reasons: (1) they help to share the risks and expenses of R&amp;D and therefore help to both accelerate the development process and to build our scientific understanding more rapidly; (2) they leverage additional R&amp;D funding for vaccines and medicines primarily targeting diseases of the developing world that would not normally meet a company&#39;s return on investment principle; and (3) they help to ensure that these vaccines and medicines reach those most in need as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The past and ongoing efforts to develop the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate serve as an innovative model of how the public and private sectors can work together in a productive way to deliver an effective malaria vaccine as quickly as possible to those who need it most. Successful collaboration will also be key to ensuring long-term success for RTS,S&mdash;for example with national governments and their malaria control and EPI programs, multilateral agencies, GAVI, the Global Fund and other donors.</p>]]></HtmlText>
