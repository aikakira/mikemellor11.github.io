  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>We have learned from other interventions that if planning for a decision is not started years in advance, the intervention may ultimately, and unfortunately, remain unused for years after its availability. The planning and decision-making process - as well as the generation or collection of needed data - takes time and careful evaluation. The goal for the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is to minimise, to the extent possible, delays between regulatory approval, possible recommendations for use, and initiation of uptake.</p>

<p>In November 2015, WHO recommended 3-5 large pilot implementation projects in sub-Saharan Africa with moderate-to-high malaria transmission to understand how to best use RTS,S to protect young children against malaria.<sup> (a) </sup>&nbsp;Continued partnership with global organisations for malaria control and immunisation as well as funders will be needed to support the introduction and implementation of Mosquirix<sup>TM</sup> in countries who have adopted the vaccine. A shared risk approach from development to access is necessary to make sure that this vaccine candidate is available to those that need it.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The regulatory post-marketing requirements are significant, given the not-for-profit nature of this vaccine. PATH and GSK are working together to identify potential sources of funding for these studies. The Gates Foundation continues to support RTS,S through PATH that is funded to help ensure informed decision-making by malaria-endemic countries; partial funding for the baseline PhIV study.</li>
	<li>African countries will need support to develop different methods for post-marketing surveillance eg sentinel sites to further evaluate safety and impact and in parallel, preparing for vaccine implementation.</li>
	<li>Gavi has included malaria vaccine in their Vaccine Investment Strategy.<sup> (b) </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now looking into their role (and that of Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) in supporting pilot introduction projects recommended by WHO.</li>
	<li>By beginning the process now of gathering data and establishing systems to aid in decision-making, countries can determine the appropriate role of a malaria vaccine in their malaria control and EPI programs without undue delay.</li>
