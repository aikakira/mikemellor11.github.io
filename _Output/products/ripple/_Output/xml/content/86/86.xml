  <HtmlText><![CDATA[<p>Five different species of Plasmodium parasites cause malaria in different regions of the world. <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, which is targeted by the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate, is considered to be the most deadly malaria parasite, and is the predominant species causing malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>The vast majority of estimated cases (80%) and deaths (90%) occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The great majority of malaria deaths caused by the <em>Pf </em>parasite occur in children under the age of five (77%). Therefore the current priority is to make RTS,S available in this population as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In Asia and many parts of Latin America, <em>Plasmodium vivax</em> (<em>Pv</em>) is prevalent, although <em>Pf</em> is present with some hot spots. The impact of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate on clinical malaria outside Africa could therefore be more limited and would require further investigation. The potential age- and geographic extensions of RTS,S are still under discussion and would also require external funding.</p>]]></HtmlText>
